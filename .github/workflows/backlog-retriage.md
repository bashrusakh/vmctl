# Workflow 4 — Backlog Re-triage (vmctl)

Reconcile triage metadata for the bounded set of existing issues/PRs supplied to this
workflow. This is the vmctl deployment of **Workflow 4 — Backlog Re-triage**. Follow the
imported `backlog-retriage-core.md` prompt core exactly for the mission, authority rules,
and the mutation surface; this body only adds the mandatory invariant, the trusted
Policy-SHA mechanics, the bounded-batch rule, and the repository-specific label boundary.

## Mandatory contract invariant

Resolve the current repository contract from the trusted Policy SHA before making
policy-sensitive conclusions. Treat templates as evidence/input schemas according to
authoritative repository policy, not as independent mandatory checklists. Current
repository policy outranks stale automated conclusions. Contract drift invalidates only
conclusions it can materially affect.

## Trusted Policy SHA

The pre-agent step "Resolve repository policy contract at the trusted Policy SHA" has
already resolved the trusted Policy SHA for this run (the current default-branch head) and
fetched the authoritative contract files read-only under `.policy/<POLICY_SHA>/`.
`POLICY_SHA` is exported to the environment of this run.

Read the current repository contract only from `.policy/<POLICY_SHA>/`:

- `.policy/<POLICY_SHA>/.github/triage-policy.md`
- `.policy/<POLICY_SHA>/CONTRIBUTING.md`

Current repository state and authoritative maintainer decisions outrank old automated
snapshots. The current Policy SHA outranks stale automated conclusions.

## Bounded batch (cap 10)

Process only the bounded batch the pre-agent step wrote to
`.policy/backlog/<POLICY_SHA>/batch.json` (at most 10 items). Do not expand the batch into
an all-repository sweep. If one item needs disproportionate investigation, preserve the
affected managed metadata and move on; use `noop` if a completion signal is required.

Related/duplicate/fixed/supersession reasoning over pull requests is bounded to the
supplied batch metadata: this deployment exposes no PR-search or PR-list capability, so do
not attempt or claim to look up pull requests outside the supplied batch by search, list,
or identifier. Judge relatedness from the supplied titles, bodies, labels, and state
only; when that evidence cannot establish equivalence, preserve the affected state.

## vmctl managed label boundary

- Managed across the union of vmctl triage families: `bug`, `enhancement`,
  `documentation`, `question`, `refactor`, `ci`, `needs-info`, `duplicate`.
- Type reconciliation: preserve a correct contributor-applied type, fill a type that is
  clearly missing, and replace a clearly incorrect managed type (remove the wrong type and
  add the correct one). Make no change when the type is ambiguous — preserve the affected
  state rather than churning it.
- `confirmed` is human/verification-owned and out of scope: this workflow does not own
  it and must never add or remove it.
- Human-reserved (never add or remove; never infer): `priority-*`, `codex-*`,
  `approved-for-fix`, `codex-fixing`, `ready-for-human-review`, `invalid`, `wontfix`,
  `good first issue`, `help wanted`, and anything not listed as managed.
- Priority is maintainer-owned. Do not create labels. Do not auto-close/reopen issues,
  close/merge PRs, modify code, assign users, or post routine comments. vmctl
  authorizes no prerequisite/approval/decision-gate semantics for automation.

This workflow is metadata-only and silent: the agent produces no human-facing output — it
does not reproduce, validate, review code, read source/diff, or comment — and the only
repository writes it performs are the label safe outputs. When evidence is insufficient,
preserve the affected managed metadata and use `noop` if a completion signal is required —
the agent has no explanatory output channel. `needs-info` means metadata/routing
information is missing; it never means implementation proof is missing. The metadata
baseline needed to classify and route a report is the semantic type, what is broken or the
affected user-facing area, and the reported behavior; a report establishing neither the
affected area nor the reported behavior (for example "doesn't work") is missing routing
information, so `needs-info` applies even when the type is inferable. This scopes the
silence claim to the agent and its safe outputs; operator diagnostics are separate, and
gh-aw may still file run-failure or detection diagnostics as repository-level issues
outside this workflow's agent and safe outputs.

Prefer preserving an existing state over speculative churn. Use only this workflow's safe
outputs (`add-labels`, `remove-labels`). Request label adds and removes directly as plain
label names; never attach `suggest`, `rationale`, or `confidence` intent metadata — this
deployment does not use suggestion/intent review, and a suggested label is not applied.
