"""Deterministic contract validation for the vmctl agentic triage contract.

No LLM. Checks, in order:
  1. every agentic workflow source imports the shared invariant and its core,
     pinned to the exact shared-package SHA;
  2. each triage workflow source declares the metadata-only capability surface:
     checkout/status-comment/bash/cli-proxy pinned false, tools.edit pinned false
     (no filesystem write capability), the engine-level shell denial
     (engine.args containing '--deny-tool shell'), safe-outputs
     report-failure-as-issue and report-failed-jobs pinned false, no add-comment,
     a fail-closed safe-outputs allowlist permitting only the
     report-failure-as-issue/report-failed-jobs/add-labels/remove-labels key
     family (no comment/issue/discussion/PR-write class, no unknown key),
     safe-outputs.add-labels issue-intent false (no label suggestion routing),
     the direct-label prompt instruction, tools.github.toolsets exactly ['issues']
     (the 'pull_requests' toolset would expose patch-capable PR tools the declared
     'allowed' narrowing cannot suppress), tools.github.allowed-repos declared as
     the single-element array ['${{ github.repository }}'] (a bare scalar string is
     rejected by the runtime gateway), tools.github.min-integrity present, one of
     the gh-aw schema levels, and exactly the intended level, no source/diff tools
     in the github allowed list including the PR-search/list tools
     (pull_request_read, list_pull_requests, search_pull_requests), no 'confirmed'
     in allowed label lists, and the
     required type family in remove-labels;
  3. each generated lock preserves those invariants (no add_comment, no forbidden
     github tool grants, compiled GITHUB_TOOLSETS exactly 'issues', an allow-only
     guard policy whose 'repos' is the
     single-element array ['${{ github.repository }}'] and whose
     'min-integrity' is exactly the intended
     level, no residual agent write capability: no --allow-tool write and no
     --allow-all-paths in the agent job, the compiled '--deny-tool shell' flag in
     the agent invocation, add_labels issue_intent:false in both safe-output
     configs, the compiled safe-output tool set exactly the read-only label
     family (manifest tools and both config key sets), the github server env
     carrying GITHUB_READ_ONLY, the safeoutputs write-sink 'accept' list confined
     to the private repository form, no report-failed-jobs machinery, failure
     reports disabled, no
     agent-job checkout, not staged) and stays structurally in sync with its source
     (shared import pin + exact safe-output label lists);
  4. every contract file referenced by .github/triage-policy.md exists;
  5. every workflow-managed label named by the policy currently exists
     (declared in .github/labels.yml and/or present in the live repository);
  6. the pinned shared import is vendored under .github/aw/imports/** so a
     runtime/compile never needs to read the private sibling repository;
  7. locks without tool-call-limits are reported as a warning (never an error):
     gh-aw v0.89.21 drops max-calls at compile time, so declared per-tool call
     limits are not yet enforced.

A referenced *managed* label that exists in neither the declared label file nor the
live repository is an error (removed/renamed managed label). A managed label that is
live but missing from the declared reference file is a warning: the reference file is
a setup aid and may lag the authoritative live label set.

Lock checks are textual (no YAML library) and deliberately conservative. Forbidden
github tool names are matched on the real agent-visible grant surfaces
(github(<tool>) allow-tool flags and the gh-aw-manifest mcp_servers 'github' tools
list), not the whole file, because the inlined shared contract quotes some of those
names in prohibition prose; the add_comment scan is whole-file and fail-closed.

What this validator does NOT guarantee:

  - It cannot see the gh-aw compile step. It compares the shared import pin and the
    exact add-labels/remove-labels allowed lists as a textual proxy; prompt text,
    tool schemas, and general job wiring are not proven in sync. Run
    `gh aw compile --strict` for that.
  - It cannot prove what the runtime MCP gateway does. The guard policy is asserted
    as a declaration (repos exactly ['${{ github.repository }}'], min-integrity
    exactly the intended level); it does not prove the gateway confines reads to
    that scope at run time, and a runtime safety net may widen it.
  - The min-integrity assertion is a match against INTENDED_MIN_INTEGRITY, a constant
    in this file. It catches unreviewed weakening or re-strengthening of the declared
    level, but it is not itself evidence that the declared level is the right security
    posture; changing that is a deliberate decision that must update the constant.
  - The `--allow-tool write` / `--allow-all-paths` scan is a substring check over the
    agent job section. It catches those exact flags disappearing or reappearing; it
    does not prove the absence of every other capability the engine could grant.
  - The engine-level shell assertion is textual on both sides: the source must contain
    the argument pair '--deny-tool shell' in engine.args, and the lock must contain the
    compiled '--deny-tool shell' flag in the agent job. It proves the denial reaches the
    Copilot CLI invocation; it cannot prove how the CLI's approval gate behaves at run
    time, so a staged trial remains the only end-to-end evidence for that.
  - The issue-intent assertion is textual on the exposed config and on the source key. It
    proves the compiled config requests the intent-free schema; the pinned runtime script
    (gh-aw-actions/setup, pinned in the lock manifest) is what actually strips the fields,
    so a change to that pin must be re-checked against that script.
  - The safe-output surface assertion is textual on three compiled surfaces (the manifest
    'safeoutputs' tool list, both config key sets, and the write-sink 'accept' list) plus
    the manifest's GITHUB_READ_ONLY env flag. It proves which handlers the pinned compiler
    enabled and declared; it cannot prove the runtime handler module behaves as its name
    implies, so a pin change to gh-aw-actions/setup must be re-checked.
  - The source safe-output allowlist parses block-mapping keys at depth 2 under a
    'safe-outputs:' key. It rejects a comment/issue/discussion/PR-write class and any
    unknown key, but a nesting trick the textual parser cannot see (for example a
    different key shape that gh-aw itself understands but this parser does not) would not
    be caught; `gh aw compile --strict` remains the schema-level check.
  - The toolsets assertion matches the declared list and the compiled GITHUB_TOOLSETS
    value against the intended set. It proves the workflow only requests the issue
    surface; it cannot prove how the pinned github-mcp-server builds its advertised
    tool list from that value, so the toolset-level prohibition rests on the server
    version pinned in the lock manifest. A server upgrade must be re-checked against
    the toolset-to-tool mapping (a staged trial is the end-to-end evidence).

Set VALIDATE_CONTRACT_SKIP_LIVE_LABELS=1 to skip the live repository label lookup
(offline/test mode used by .github/aw/test_validate_contract.py); in that mode
.github/labels.yml must declare every managed label because the live set is not read.
The live lookup also degrades to a warning (rather than an error) when it is attempted
but cannot run at all (no `gh` binary, no auth/network, unreadable repository), so the
validator stays usable offline; when the live set IS readable, a managed label missing
from both the declared file and the live repository remains a hard error.
